Notes:
- Add a State Manager that keeps track of the state of the game, and the state of the entities in the game.
- Add a collision system that registers every object in itself and any time an objects "Move" or "SetPosition" functions are called,
  they Update that register.
  this collision system will place its own checks for any collisions, at the end of every Update.
- Implement a Graph structure that keeps a record of all the objects locations, in order to implement path finding algorithms down
  the line... In Sha Allah.
