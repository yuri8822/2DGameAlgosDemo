# 2DGameAlgosDemo
This is a simple project that i wish to do just for fun, to explore the different algorithms that are required for a typical 2D game. I aim to implement interesting algorithms such as path finding, collision detection and more as i delve into it deeper. i also seek to implement multithreaded input. This will be made using the SDL2 x64 Library for C++.
